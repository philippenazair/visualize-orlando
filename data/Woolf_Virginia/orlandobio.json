Her family on both sides was part of the \"intellectual ascendancy\".\n      Though many of her forebears were\n      Quakers\n      or Evangelicals, both parents had become agnostic. In her own account of her class and intellectual inheritance, she wrote that she was born \"not of rich parents, but of well-to-do parents . . . into a very communicative, literate, letter-writing, visiting, articulate, late nineteenth-century world.\"\n      She was vividly aware of \"thousands of ancestresses in the past\"\n      \u2014\"Note 'ancestresses',\"\n      writes Hermione Lee\u2014and her work is preoccupied by moments and figures that are unacknowledged by patriarchal culture and by exploration of \"states of mind so muted that they almost defied expression.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      In her forties, after watching a village wedding, VW wrote: \"We dont belong to any 'class'; we thinkers: might as well be French or German. Yet I am English in some way.\"\n      Her calling herself an 'Outsider' is famous, and so is her statement: \"in fact, as a woman, I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.\"\n      But this statement is set (into\n      Three Guineas\n      ) as part of a less-known passage. It continues:\n      <div class=\"blockquote\">\n       And if, when reason has said its say, still some obstinate emotion remains, some love of England dropped into a child's ears by the cawing of rooks in an elm tree, by the splash of waves on a beach, or by English voices murmuring nursery rhymes, this drop of pure, if irrational, emotion she will make serve her to give to England first what she desires of peace and freedom for the whole world.\n      </div>\n      VW's work is everywhere full of that 'obstinate emotion', whether in Clarissa Dalloway's morning lark, buying the flowers herself, or in Jacob Flanders at about twenty lying in a field of buttercups, or in the flight of the \"swallows\u2014or martins were they?\u2014\" in\n      Between the Acts\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW's childhood sexual experience was painful, humiliating, and formative, and her adult sexuality has been much discussed since publication of\n      \"A Sketch of the Past\"\n      ,\n      \"22 Hyde Park Gate\"\n      , and\n      \"Old Bloomsbury\"\n      in\n      Moments of Being: Unpublished Autobiographical Writings\n      , 1976.\n      She later shared the principled objections of her Bloomsbury friends to the Victorian social management of sexuality, which they saw as based on possessiveness, jealousy, and exploitation. Her own erotic relationships were with individuals of both sexes.\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Mother\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW's mother, n\u00e9e\n      Julia Prinsep Jackson\n      (1846-95), was born in India and brought to England as a toddler.\n      She was a favourite niece (and subject) of photographer\n      Julia Margaret Cameron\n      , on whom she published an entry in the\n      Dictionary of National Biography\n      . She grew up in Pre-Raphaelite circles and was admired by, among others,\n      Elizabeth Robins\n      ,\n      G. F. Watts\n      ,\n      Edward Burne-Jones\n      , and\n      William Holman Hunt\n      (who proposed to her).\n      She married Herbert Duckworth in 1867, but was suddenly widowed in 1870, while pregnant with Gerald, their third child (whose birth followed those of George and Stella). After Herbert's death, Julia lost her faith and \"found much of interest in the essays of Leslie Stephen on religion and agnosticism.\"\n      She married Leslie Stephen eight years later (on 26 March 1878), and the four Stephen children (Vanessa, Thoby, Virginia, and Adrian) followed in quick succession. She taught the children herself, at the dining-room table.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Julia Stephen was known for her beauty, melancholy, and charitable good works. VW's biographer Hermione Lee remarks that she \"seems to have fully endorsed the Victorian models for female behaviour.\"\n      Like her husband, she had a sombre mien, and with him she \"shared a view of life as work.\"\n      She had a Victorian devotion to the ill and poor, and she was especially passionate about nursing. (She published an essay on it\u2014\n      <em>\n       Notes from Sick Rooms\n      </em>\n      \u2014in 1883.) In June 1889 she was a signatory (one of 103) to Mary Augusta Ward's\n      \"An Appeal Against Female Suffrage\"\n      in\n      Nineteenth Century\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Julia Stephen wrote stories\u2014\"family tales with a message\"\n      \u2014for her children, and she was the most valued reader of their family newspaper, the\n      \"Hyde Park Gate News\"\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       5 May 1895\n      </strong>\n      Julia Stephen\n      , Leslie Stephen's wife and VW's mother, died at the age of forty-nine from either influenza or rheumatic fever, a condition exacerbated by overwork.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Julia's death plunged her husband into overwhelming grief.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Virginia was thirteen: this death ended her childhood and provoked her first nervous breakdown. She said later that her mother's death was \"the greatest disaster that could happen,\"\n      and she remained preoccupied by her lost mother until she wrote her into Mrs Ramsay of\n      To the Lighthouse\n      . Phyllis Rose observes that \"the natural adolescent process of detachment from her mother ended catastrophically,\" leaving her hungry for affection and mentally haunted by her mother,\n      and\n      Hermione Lee\n      believes that \"coming to terms with\" Julia's death and \"laying this ghost to rest, is one of the secret plots of Virginia Woolf's existence.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Years later, looking back, VW attached to this time a shift in her creative development, the sharpening of her sensations and thoughts. She met her brother\n      Thoby\n      at\n      Paddington Station\n      when he came to Julia's funeral. Her view of the sunset there sparked her belief that \"my mother's death unveiled and intensified; made me suddenly develop perceptions, as if a burning glass had been laid over what was shaded and dormant.\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Father\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW's father,\n      Sir Leslie Stephen\n      (1832-1904), was \"a Victorian philosopher and historian of ideas . . . literary historian and critic, and\u2014perhaps most important\u2014a biographer.\"\n      Mark Hussey writes that he was, \"after\n      Matthew Arnold\n      , the most important late-Victorian man of letters.\"\n      He was also a passionate walker and hiker. Educated at\n      Eton\n      and\n      Trinity Hall\n      , Cambridge, he returned there as a junior tutor in 1856, after serving the Church first as a deacon, then as a parson. But like many contemporaries, Stephen lost his faith\u2014\"rather painlessly . . . over the problem of evil,\" according to S. P. Rosenbaum, who quotes him: \"The potter has no right to be angry with his pots. . . . If he wanted them different, he should have made them different. The consistent theologian must choose between the Creator and the Judge.\"\n      As an agnostic, Stephen could no longer discharge his duties in good faith, so he resigned his tutorship in 1860, and finally left Cambridge (still officially an Anglican institution) in 1864. On 23 March 1875 he formally renounced his priesthood in the company of\n      Thomas Hardy\n      , whom he had asked to witness his signature.\n      A passionate free-thinker, Stephen attacked religion \"as the breeding ground of intolerance and hypocrisy.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      He was immensely influential. As editor of the\n      Cornhill Magazine\n      from 1871 to 1882, he published\n      Henry James\n      ,\n      Thomas Hardy\n      ,\n      Matthew Arnold\n      ,\n      Robert Browning\n      , and\n      George Meredith\n      , among others.\n      He was the first editor of the\n      Dictionary of National Biography\n      , for which he edited the first twenty-six volumes and wrote many entries himself, giving up this work in 1890 only because of exhaustion.\n      Stephen also wrote what Hermione Lee calls \"vigorous lives\" of\n      Johnson\n      ,\n      Pope\n      ,\n      Swift\n      ,\n      Hobbes\n      , and\n      George Eliot\n      for\n      John Morley\n      's\n      English Men of Letters\n      series, as well as a series of essays published in the\n      Cornhill\n      as\n      <em>\n       Hours in a Library\n      </em>\n      .\n      His work in biography (which he believed was an essential ingredient of history) had a powerfully formative influence in his daughter's development as a writer, and so did his intellectual courage. S. P. Rosenbaum, who writes that she \"was, after all, the writer-father's writer-daughter,\" also sees Leslie Stephen as \"the father of that extended family of writers and artists which formed around his children and is now known as the Bloomsbury Group.\"\n      Lyndall Gordon\n      (in her entry on Woolf in the\n      Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n      ) voices the suspicion that his \"unorthodox tramps\", walks taken not on the path but across uncharted country, may have had even deeper influence.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Notwithstanding his great intellectual influence and major achievements\u2014the\n      Dictionary of National Biography\n      is a lasting monument\u2014Stephen thought himself a failure. He was morose and needy, plagued by an \"obsession with his 'genius' and his reputation.\" His friend Henry James referred to his \"ineffable and impossible taciturnity and dreariness.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Stephen's sombre attitude was a consequence in part of his sad marital history. He married his first wife,\n      Harriet Marian (Minny) Thackeray\n      (younger daughter of\n      William Makepeace Thackeray\n      , sister of Anne Thackeray Ritchie) in 1867. She bore him a daughter,\n      Laura\n      , in 1870, but died in premature childbirth in 1875. Julia, whom he married in 1878, died in 1895.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Quentin Bell\n      writes that Stephen saw himself as \"a skinless man, so nothing was to touch him save [Julia's] soothing and healing hand.\"\n      Julia's children felt that \"he wore her out with his demands for support.\"\n      After her death, he demanded that Stella step into Julia's role in the household. He was \"extortionate, melodramatic.\"\n      When Stella married Jack Hills, he transferred his expectation of support to his next daughter. This permanently alienated Vanessa, but Virginia's feelings for him \"survived the worst outrages of his performance as a widower.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       22 February 1904\n      </strong>\n      Leslie Stephen\n      , VW's father, died of bowel cancer. He had become ill in 1900, and his slow decline was very hard on his children; Virginia's second serious bout of mental illness followed shortly afterwards.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Of Leslie Stephen's relations, Virginia was closest to the writer\n      Anne Thackeray Ritchie\n      (Minny Stephen's sister), and to\n      Caroline Emelia Stephen\n      (Leslie's sister).\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Vanessa\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Virginia and\n      Vanessa\n      (1879-1961, the eldest of Leslie and Julia Stephen's children), were close to one another throughout their lives. In\n      \"A Sketch of the Past\"\n      , VW recalls that after the death of their stepsister Stella in 1897 they became a \"very close conspiracy. In that world of many men, coming and going, we formed our private nucleus.\"\n      Growing up, both wished for independent artistic careers. In 1901 Vanessa was admitted to the Painting School of the\n      Royal Academy of Arts\n      ; in 1905 she exhibited for the first time and also founded the\n      Friday Club\n      , \"a disparate group of artists, mainly women, for the purpose of discussion and exhibition of the members' work.\"\n      In 1906, two days after her brother Thoby's death from typhoid fever, she agreed to marry\n      Clive Bell\n      . Their first child,\n      Julian Thoby Bell\n      , was born in 1908, their second,\n      Quentin\n      , in 1910. In 1912 Vanessa exhibited at the second Post-Impressionist Exhibition, and a year later became, with\n      Roger Fry\n      and\n      Duncan Grant\n      , a director of the\n      Omega Workshops\n      . In 1916 she moved to\n      Charleston\n      in\n      Sussex\n      to live with Duncan Grant and\n      David Garnett\n      .\n      Angelica\n      , her third child (with Grant, though her husband, Clive Bell, was represented as the father), was born in 1918.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The two sisters were artistic collaborators: Vanessa designed the dustjackets for all of Woolf's books after\n      Jacob's Room\n      in 1922 except\n      Orlando\n      and\n      <em>\n       A Letter to a Young Poet\n      </em>\n      , and for many other books besides.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Though Virginia loved her sister deeply and longed for her acceptance and approval, she was at some level envious of Vanessa's marriage and motherhood. She began an intense flirtation with Clive Bell after Julian was born, beginning in February 1908.\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Thoby\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Virginia's elder brother, Thoby (1880-1906), was confident, talented, charming, and very important to her. At\n      Trinity College, Cambridge\n      , he developed a circle of friends who were to be the core of the Bloomsbury Group. These included Leonard Woolf, whom Virginia met through him.\n      Thoby\n      died of typhoid fever in November 1906. In\n      Jacob's Room\n      , 1922, VW movingly evokes his memory and merges her personal loss of her brother with the wider loss of thousands of young men in the First World War. Her memories of Thoby also went into the creation of Percival in\n      The Waves\n      , 1931. When Vanessa read this novel, she wrote to Virginia: \"if you wouldn't think me foolish I should say that you have found the 'lullaby capable of singing him to rest.'\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Adrian\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Adrian\n      (1883-1948) was the youngest Stephen child. After Vanessa's marriage he lived with Virginia at 29 Fitzroy Square, then moved with her to 38 Brunswick Square. Like Thoby, he studied at\n      Trinity College, Cambridge\n      , where he read law. He later studied medicine and in 1926 qualified as a psychiatrist. It was he who, with Horace Cole, concocted the Dreadnought Hoax. During the First World War, he argued (unsuccessfully) on behalf of the conscientious objectors\n      Lytton Strachey\n      ,\n      Duncan Grant\n      , and\n      David Garnett\n      . He was a politically active pacifist who worked in the\n      No-Conscription Fellowship\n      and the\n      National Council for Civil Liberties\n      . Before the Second World War he was actively anti-fascist, and Hussey reports that \"he alerted the Woolfs to the savagery of the\n      Nazis\n      and provided them with enough morphine for suicide should the Nazis invade England.\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Quentin Bell\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Quentin Bell\n      , VW's younger nephew, many years later became his aunt's biographer and editor. In a preface to a general-interest booklet, he wrote that among his \"fairly large collection of aunts and uncles,\" many of them a pleasure for him and his brother to visit, the Woolfs were special. \"Hogarth House was a treat\" for schoolboys, where Leonard's dry humour and Virginia's \"fantastic sallies\", perfect foils to each other, provided \"enchantment of a more splendid kind\" than the cinema.\n      Bell continued: \"The person who called Bloomsbury 'Gloomsbury' cannot have known Virginia. Her laughter made a paradise of Richmond.\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Step-siblings\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Leslie Stephen\n      's daughter from his previous marriage,\n      Laura\n      (1868-1934), suffered from some form of mental disability and lived most of her life in institutions.\n      Julia Stephen\n      had three children from her first marriage: George, Stella, and Gerald Duckworth. Both Duckworth brothers were educated at\n      Eton\n      and\n      Cambridge\n      .\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Stella\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Virginia and Vanessa had deep affection for their half-sister Stella (1869-97), who seems not to have shared her brothers' fixation on 'society' and who was closely attached to her mother. After Julia's death, Stella, then twenty-six, assumed the maternal role in relation to the Stephen children and faithfully looked after the extravagantly grieving Leslie. Lyndall Gordon calls her VW's \"half-sister and surrogate mother.\"\n      When she accepted a proposal of marriage from John Waller Hills in 1896, Leslie made it clear that he felt abandoned. Stella died three months after her marriage.\n      Lee writes that Virginia and Vanessa thought of Stella's sad life \"as the epitome of 'all the old abuses' and vices of the family system.\" It became \"the basis for Virginia Woolf's analysis of the tyranny and hypocrisy of the Victorian fathers.\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      George\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The eldest of Julia's children from her first marriage,\n      George Duckworth\n      (1868-1934), was ten when his mother married VW's father. He grew into a conservative young man and a social climber. After Julia's death, when Leslie Stephen was enacting \"his pitiable histrionics\",\n      George became the Stephen girls' \"unofficial guardian\",\n      responsible for their social education.\n      He insisted on bringing Virginia and Vanessa into his 'fashionable' London society. Virginia in particular was forced to endure unpleasant and humiliating social occasions for which she had no taste. Lyndall Gordon writes that at these events she \"would know and speak to nobody all evening and would stand, crushed by the crowd, against the wall. On one occasion she managed to read Tennyson behind a curtain.\"\n      Both Virginia and\n      Vanessa\n      bitterly resented George for forcing on them his own values and lifestyle, and for his insensitivity about the financial difference between them. (During this period he had an annual income of \u00a31,000 while they had annual allowances of \u00a350 each.) In\n      \"A Sketch of the Past\"\n      , VW calls this time the \"Greek slave years\".\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      George and his brother Gerald also abused Virginia sexually.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       From about 1900\n      </strong>\n      Virginia Stephen endured the sexual aggression of her half-brother\n      George Duckworth\n      . After returning from the 'fashionable' balls and parties he escorted her to, he would pursue her into her bedroom and fondle her.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      After Julia's and Stella's deaths, writes Lyndall Gordon, \"there was no controlling George . . . who would prowl by night, and pounce.\" At the same time: \"Shame and Victorian proprieties forbade mention of this.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       September 1903\n      </strong>\n      As Virginia Stephen's\n      father\n      was dying, Virginia's half-brother\n      George Duckworth\n      fondled her several times in a manner that amounted to sexual assault.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW described the incidents much later in\n      \"22 Hyde Park Gate\"\n      , 1921, and\n      \"Old Bloomsbury\"\n      , 1922, both talks prepared for her friends in the\n      Memoir Club\n      . She also wrote about them to Vanessa.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Mark Hussey writes that the \"incest that Woolf suffered has been variously euphemized by several of her biographers and other critics.\"\n      Hermione Lee, who sees George as one of the tyrants in VW's childhood, finds the evidence of sexual abuse both \"strong\" and \"ambiguous\". Though the events remain hazy, \"Virginia Woolf herself thought that what had been done to her was very damaging.\"\n      Critic\n      Louise DeSalvo\n      writes that VW was \"a sexually abused child; she was an incest survivor.\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Gerald\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Gerald Duckworth\n      (1870-1937) established the firm that became\n      Duckworth &amp; Co.\n      , publishers.

He left her with lasting feelings of shame.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW did not discuss this incident specifically until the last years of her life.\n      Hermione Lee\n      , who considers the matter as fully as possible, argues that \"it would be rash to ignore or belittle the damage done to her sense of herself, at this moment, by the much older half-brother's predatory intrusion.\" She sees in VW's representations of childhood a recurrent \"moment of fear or shame or panic, the image of a safe private world being invaded, often with the strong sense of sexual threat.\"\n     </div>\n<h3>\n      Childhood and the End of Childhood\n     </h3>\n<h4>\n      First Places\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW's imagination attached richly to place. In a well-known passage of\n      \"A Sketch of the Past\"\n      , she identifies her earliest memory of\n      Cornwall\n      as the foundation of her consciousness. If life, she says, is \"a bowl that one fills and fills and fills\u2014then my bowl without a doubt stands upon this memory,\" and with that memory of rich, sharp early consciousness, comes also \"the purest ecstasy I can conceive.\"\n      Leslie Stephen came upon\n      Talland House\n      at\n      St Ives\n      in\n      Cornwall\n      while he was on a walking tour in 1882. It had \"a perfect view across the sea to\n      Godrevy lighthouse\n      .\"\n      He rented it, and the family spent summer holidays there until the early 1890s.\n      The house, the sea, and the lighthouse provide the setting for VW's best-known novel,\n      To the Lighthouse\n      . VW returned to Cornwall, physically and imaginatively, many times in her life.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Virginia grew up in the house at 22 Hyde Park Gate. This is where the Stephen and Duckworth families lived together until Leslie Stephen's death. VW remembered the tall, narrow house of her childhood as \"tangled and matted with emotion.\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      First Interests\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW's early childhood was full of interests and activities, most shared with her siblings. They played cricket and charades, did photography, swam, went moth hunting. These childhood entertainments return in VW's imaginative writing, which is built so substantially on memory. Moth-hunting, which she associated with Thoby, \"most haunted her imagination,\" writes Hermione Lee.\n      At least equally important was Virginia's early story-telling and writing.\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Early 'Breakdowns'\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      This childhood suffered a series of heavy blows. Virginia's early sexual molestation was followed by a series of terrible deaths: her mother's, when she was thirteen; Stella's, when she was fifteen. These losses, suffered when she was moving from childhood to adolescence, were followed, when she was in her early twenties, by her father's and Thoby's deaths. After her mother's death, Virginia had, by her own account in \"Sketch made in summer 1939\", \"my first 'breakdown'\".\n      She was troubled by a racing pulse and complex feelings of numbness, confusion, and anger; she spent two years in (again her own words) \"a state of physical distress.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       19 July 1897\n      </strong>\n      The recently married Stella Duckworth, VW's half-sister, died at the age of twenty-eight.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Later VW felt that this loss was in some ways worse than her mother's. Lee writes that her \"irritability in her 1897 journal, her nervousness and her attacks of the 'fidgets', can be read as symptoms of her illness.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Shortly after the death of her\n      father\n      in May 1904, Virginia Stephen experienced a second and more serious nervous breakdown. She was nursed for nearly three months at the home of her friend\n      Violet Dickinson\n      , where she attempted suicide. The suicide attempt, this time jumping out of a window, was the first of several.\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Education\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Virginia Woolf was educated at home. As a very young girl, she was tutored by her\n      mother\n      in Latin, French, and history.

In 1902, however, the Cambridge-educated\n      Janet Case\n      , who was a feminist as well as a classicist, took over as tutor, and with her Virginia learned to read difficult texts not only with great rigour but also with appreciation and pleasure.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Nevertheless, Virginia continued to feel her educational isolation, especially after her brother Thoby had gone up to Cambridge. \"Theres nothing like talk as an educator I'm sure,\" she wrote to him.\n      Like many of her female contemporaries, VW longed to go to university. To a certain extent she participated in university life through Thoby, to whom she wrote about literary matters and who, she said in\n      Moments of Being\n      , \"first told me\u2014handing it on as something worth knowing\u2014about the Greeks.\"\n      She said later that the intense and rigorous talk of the early\n      Bloomsbury Group\n      meetings gave her an understanding of the experience of undergraduates. Nevertheless her exclusion from university later figured prominently in VW's writing, and she identified access to higher education and the professions as the necessary condition of women's development.\n     </div>\n<h3>\n      Early Women Friends\n     </h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Virginia's tutor\n      Janet Case\n      became her lifelong friend.\n      In her late teens she had an array of female friends of ten to twenty years older than herself:\n      Violet Dickinson\n      , philanthropic Quaker, Kitty Maxse, Kensington hostess,\n      Nelly (Lady Eleanor) Cecil\n      , aristocratic writer (officially known as 'Lady Robert Cecil'), Virginia's cousin Emma Vaughan, and Emma's sister-in-law Madge Vaughan (who was daughter of the writer\n      John Addington Symonds\n      and mother of the college principal\n      Janet Vaughan\n      ). Most were women of achievement, and with each the relationship was somewhat erotic.

She was deeply frustrated by the lingering restrictions imposed on her after her spell of illness, and by not having a room of her own.\n      At Gordon Square permanently by December 1904, she began the 'street haunting' (preferably at dusk in winter for \"the champagne brightness of the air and the sociability of the streets\"),\n      which she was to continue all her life and to publish an essay on in 1927.\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Work\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       14 January 1905\n      </strong>\n      Virginia Stephen (later VW) began giving weekly classes at\n      Morley College\n      in\n      Lambeth\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      This college, founded in 1885, offered evening classes to working women and men.

Personal transitions in the lives of the group members coincided with change in the broader sphere, from the time Leslie Stephen's children began to live newly independent lives when he died in 1904.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Early members of what VW called\n      \"Old Bloomsbury\"\n      (to distinguish the original members of the group from later additions) included Virginia and\n      Vanessa Stephen\n      ,\n      Leonard Woolf\n      ,\n      Clive Bell\n      ,\n      E.

Over time, the group expanded to include other friends and younger members (such as the Bell children,\n      Julian Bell\n      ,\n      Quentin\n      and\n      Angelica\n      , and\n      David Garnett\n      ), and, in what Quentin Bell called \"almost a second generation of Bloomsbury,\"\n      Rupert Brooke\n      ,\n      Katherine Cox\n      , Jacques Raverat (husband of\n      Gwen Raverat\n      ),\n      Frances Darwin\n      (later Cornford), and others.\n      Other figures who though not of Bloomsbury are sometimes associated with it include:\n      Carrington\n      ,\n      Lady Ottoline Morrell\n      , and\n      T. S. Eliot\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The group's name, derived from the area of London in which several of its members lived (the area that includes the\n      University of London\n      ) flags a key feature: it met in personal spaces and was drawn and held together over the years by personal relationships and shared interests. As time passed, 'Bloomsbury' migrated to a variety of locations: after Vanessa married Clive Bell, in 1907, Adrian and Virginia moved to\n      29 Fitzroy Square\n      , and continued the meetings there; during the war it met in a club in\n      Soho\n      ;\n      after the war \"outposts such as\n      Charleston\n      , where Vanessa, Grant and Garnett had moved in 1916, and the Woolfs' Sussex home,\n      Monk's House\n      , became new centers of Bloomsbury activity.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The cultural production of members of 'Bloomsbury' was prodigious, embracing the imaginative, critical, and political writing of Virginia and\n      Leonard Woolf\n      ,\n      E. M. Forster\n      , and\n      Lytton Strachey\n      , the economic theories of\n      Maynard Keynes\n      , the painting of\n      Vanessa Bell\n      , and\n      Clive Bell\n      's art criticism (especially\n      <em>\n       Art\n      </em>\n      , 1914, which theorised modern painting).\n      Roger Fry\n      's\n      Grafton Gallery\n      exhibition,\n      Manet and the Post-Impressionists\n      , which opened on 6 November 1910, had major cultural impact, and so did his establishment with Vanessa Bell and\n      Duncan Grant\n      of the\n      Omega Workshops\n      , which opened at 33 Fitzroy Square on 8 July 1913.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      'Bloomsbury' came to designate a new sensibility in philosophy, literature, art, and politics, and its growth has been linked with \"the crucial break between the 'Edwardians' and the 'Georgians', the point when 'human character changed'\"\n      (as VW wrote famously in her essay\n      \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\"\n      ). In 1910 (the year Woolf named as representing the break with the past), political, social, and aesthetic change was everywhere.\n      King Edward VII\n      died (on 6 May); there was a constitutional crisis over the powers of the\n      House of Lords\n      in relation to financial decisions of the\n      House of Commons\n      ; Women's Suffrage politics were at their most heated (with 119 suffragists arrested on 'Black Friday', 18 November, for marching on the House of Commons); the\n      Liberal\n      Government of Prime Minister\n      Asquith\n      held shakily to its authority. In a book analysing the forces at work in this year of change,\n      Peter Stansky\n      writes that there was \"a sense of living in parlous times.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      In an atmosphere of social, political, and artistic upheaval, art and politics merged in the public mind, and 'Bloomsbury' was perceived as politically and aesthetically revolutionary. Stansky quotes a critic writing in the\n      Daily Herald\n      , a\n      Labour\n      paper: \"The Post-Impressionists are in the company of the Great Rebels of the World. In politics the only movements worth considering are Woman Suffrage and Socialism. They are both Post-Impressionist in their desire to scrap old decaying forms and find for themselves a new working ideal.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Later, however, Bloomsbury was attacked as an arrogant, self-regarding, immoral, upper-class clique.\n      D. H. Lawrence\n      said Keynes and his friends were \"black beetles\", and in\n      Women in Love\n      he attacked the group's aesthetic in general and\n      Lady Ottoline Morrell\n      l in particular. Many other writers, some from inside, some from outside the group, published satiric portraits\u2014\n      Wyndham Lewis\n      ,\n      Marjorie Strachey\n      ,\n      Flora Mayor\n      ,\n      Osbert Sitwell\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Piecing together its intellectual family tree, scholars and critics have looked both forward and back from Bloomsbury. It has been seen as descending from the late eighteenth-century\n      Clapham Sect\n      (to which VW's great-grandfather\n      James Stephen\n      belonged) and from the\n      Cambridge University\n      secret society 'the\n      Apostles\n      ' (to which several members of the Bloomsbury group, including VW's husband, had been elected). It has also been seen as having given birth to later clusters of aesthetic and intellectual friends, including the\n      Memoir Club\n      founded by\n      Molly MacCarthy\n      in 1920. Lee writes that \"Bloomsbury persisted as an organism for over thirty or forty years in the form of little overlapping groups and clubs\"; these \"sprang up for the purposes of discussions or play-readings or exhibitions or domestic entertainment.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      When it began, however, it was friends and it was talk. \"Talk\", VW wrote in\n      \"Old Bloomsbury\"\n      (which she read as a paper to the\n      Memoir Club\n      near the end of 1921 or in 1922) \"even the talk which had such tremendous results upon the lives and characters of the two Miss Stephens . . . is as elusive as smoke.\"\n      But she remembered the excitement of the talk, which kept them still \"sitting in a circle at two or three in the morning.\"\n      To her and to Vanessa, she said, it gave \"the pleasure that undergraduates get when they meet friends of their own for the first time.\"\n      It challenged her mind as nothing had yet done: \"Never have I listened so intently to each step and half-step in an argument. Never have I been at such pains to sharpen and launch my little dart. And then what joy it was when one's contribution was accepted.\"\n      Another liberation was the group's absence of interest in conventional feminine self-presentation, a little later by its absence of restraint in conversation about sex. \"Sex permeated our conversation,\" she told the Memoir Club.\n      \"Indeed the future of Bloomsbury was to prove that many variations can be played on the theme of sex.\"\n      This frankness and freedom about sex and gender roles, was a consequential fact in the lives of all of the members of the group, and it had great impact on VW's work, which, in one of its dimensions, reworks the conventions defining 'woman'.\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Family Milestones\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       8 September 1906\n      </strong>\n      Virginia and\n      Vanessa Stephen\n      (later Woolf and Bell) and\n      Violet Dickinson\n      left England for\n      Greece\n      , where at\n      Olympia\n      on 13 September they met up with\n      Thoby\n      and\n      Adrian Stephen\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      This holiday was marred by sickness and ultimately by calamity.

(Leonard's sisters Clara and Flora were active in the suffrage movement.)\n      Naomi Black writes that VW's \"memberships thus place her squarely in the middle of the organizational network of social feminism in Britain.\"\n      VW associated frequently with women who were passionately involved with suffragism, such as\n      Marjorie\n      ,\n      Pernel\n      , and\n      Pippa Strachey\n      ,\n      Margaret Llewelyn Davies\n      , and later\n      Ethel Smyth\n      . The women's movement appears frequently in her works, both fictional and polemical, including\n      Night and Day\n      ,\n      The Years\n      and\n      Three Guineas\n      . Hermione Lee writes that \"the suffragists' tactics of battering on the doors of the excluding establishments worked their way lastingly into her imagination.

The NUWSS supported the government, and on August the sixth resolved to suspend political activity in favour of working to help those displaced and otherwise damaged by the war. A number of prominent members, including\n      Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence\n      and\n      Maude Royden\n      , resigned to form the\n      Women's International League\n      .

For those after 1912, however, Leonard provided the witness of his \"minutely kept diaries . . . coded in Tamil and Sinhalese,\" letters, and memoirs. Lee summarizes Leonard's view of Virginia's illness: \"that she was manic depressive . . . that her illness could be controlled by a regulated pattern of rest and food, and that it was related to her creative genius, to her intense work-levels and to the stress of finishing a book.\" This is, says Lee, like other contemporary views of the matter, a \"self-protecting narrative.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Modern Woolf scholars are likely to reject the notion that VW was, as her family liked to joke, 'mad as a hatter', and to believe, as Lyndall Gordon does, that her \"instability had some biochemical base which was not understood.\"\n      As a corrective to commentary which represents VW as insane and as a victim, Hermione Lee bases her analysis on the strong assertion that \"Virginia Woolf was a sane woman who had an illness . . . a person of exceptional courage, intelligence and stoicism.\" She attributes VW's illness to \"genetic, environmental and biological factors.\"\n      Asserting that VW's letters and diaries make hers \"perhaps the most fully documented literary life of the twentieth century\"\n      , Stephen Trombley, examines \"the way in which those suspected of harbouring madness have been dealt with, especially if they happen to be women.\"\n      He analyses the assumptions of VW's doctors (Savage, Craig and Hyslop) and places them \"firmly within the history of the discourse of power.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW was troubled by a range of intermittent mental and physical problems as an adult. They varied from mild to almost unbearably severe, and included anxiety attacks, hallucinations, fevers, headaches, and an extreme reluctance (or refusal) to eat. Critics have suggested many different causes, both genetic (mainly from the Stephen side) and situational (with pressures caused by family relations, sexual abuse, her writing, war, and other concerns).\n      Doctors responded by prescribing drugs, breaks from reading and writing, and rest cures at Jean Thomas's nursing home for women at\n      Burley Park\n      in\n      Twickenham\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW's varying reactions to her own illnesses included guilt about what she saw as her lack of mental and moral control over her body; deep anger toward her physicians and the larger operational codes of the medical profession; and fascination with the great creative power she sometimes gained when she was ill.\n      She sensed this power after her\n      mother\n      's death in 1895, and in 1922 wrote:\n      <div class=\"blockquote\">\n       Once or twice I have felt that odd whirr of wings in the head which comes when I am ill so often . . . .

Leonard was much occupied with his political work throughout his career. He wrote for (and sometimes edited) the\n      New Statesman\n      , the\n      Nation and Athen\u00e6um\n      , and\n      <em>\n       International Review\n      </em>\n      ; he was heavily involved with suffragism, the\n      Labour Party\n      , the\n      Fabian Society\n      , and the\n      League of Nations\n      , among other affiliations.

She leaves a barb: \"Thus, though women have every reason to hope that the intellect of the male sex is steadily diminishing, it would be unwise, until they have more evidence than the great war and the great peace supply, to announce it as a fact.\"\n      The Affable Hawk returned to his point that in intellectual pursuits, in spite of education, women cannot equal men. VW's second letter cites Sappho and Ethel Smyth as women whose creativity had to overcome social and material obstacles and outlines the necessary conditions for creative work of genius: \"the conditions which make it possible for a Shakespeare to exist are that he shall have had predecessors in his art, shall make one of a group where art is freely discussed and practised, and shall himself have the utmost of freedom of action and experience. Perhaps in Lesbos, but never since, have these conditions been the lot of women.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       1 July 1919\n      </strong>\n      VW and her husband\n      Leonard\n      purchased their country home,\n      Monk's House\n      in the village of\n      Rodmell\n      , near\n      Lewes\n      in\n      Sussex\n      , for \u00a3700. \"The name was invented by a real estate agent and the house had nothing to do with the church next to it.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW thrived on the energy of London, but the country was a quiet refuge for her.

It was sometimes disrupted, but often consisted of creative or critical writing in the morning; revising around lunchtime; diary- or letter-writing after tea; and visiting or reading (sometimes for review) in the evenings.\n     </div>\n<h3>\n      World War I\n     </h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The Woolfs' first years in Hogarth House were war years. The war in the air astonished and terrified Londoners, most of whom had never seen an aeroplane. \"In the bitterly cold winter of 1917-18, they spent many nights waking up or interrupting their dinner parties, to go down to the basement with 'clothes, quilts, a watch and a torch', and sit on wooden boxes in the coal cellar, or lie on mattresses in the kitchen, during the bombardments.\"\n      The experience is written into\n      The Years\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Like many of her friends and associates, VW was staunchly anti-war. Her brother Adrian was an active pacifist and secretary of the\n      No-Conscription Fellowship\n      , and she and many friends were 'COs', or Conscientious Objectors. Moreover, the \"Women's Movement had split over whether or not to support the fighting, and Woolf's sympathies were with the women working for peace.\"\n      In a letter to\n      Margaret Llewelyn Davies\n      VW called the war \"a preposterous masculine fiction\" (a description, she said, based on a daily reading of the\n      Times\n      , which made the male part of Britain, or perhaps Europe, seem like \"some curious tribe in Central Africa\").\n     </div>\n<h3>\n      The Hogarth Press\n     </h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The Woolfs were planning to acquire a printing press as early as 22 February 1915, when Virginia wrote to\n      Margaret Llewelyn Davies\n      about their excitement over the prospect: \"there's a chance of damaging the\n      Webb\n      influence\n      irretrievably, (which is my ambition in life). Presses only cost \u00a317.17, and can be worked easily.\"\n      When the dream became a reality the political motive became linked with an equally strong literary one, and the idea that it would all be easy simply faded.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       23 March 1917\n      </strong>\n      Virginia and\n      Leonard Woolf\n      ordered a printing press.

The Excelsior Printing and Supply Company charged \u00a319.5s.5d. for a small hand press, some type, and an instruction booklet; but when the press arrived, on 24 April, it had not been properly packed for its great weight, and was broken (or in Woolf's words, \"smashed in half!\").\n      The type came in great solid blocks that had to be broken up and sorted by letter and font. By 2 May they had set up the type for their first publication: not yet\n      Two Stories\n      , but a handbill advertising it. Virginia was finding the manual labour \"exciting, soothing, ennobling and satisfying,\" and although Leonard \"heaved a terrific sigh and said 'I wish to God we'd never bought the cursed thing!'\" he explained this remark by adding that this was only because he would now \"never do anything else.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Once the press was repaired they printed their handbill. Their first book (\n      Two Stories\n      , containing Virginia's\n      \"The Mark on the Wall\"\n      and Leonard's\n      \"Three Jews\"\n      ) had to be set up and printed two pages at a time; after that they had to break up the type in order to set the next two pages, because their stock of type was so small. Nonetheless, after working almost every afternoon for two months, they published\n      Two Stories\n      in July that year. In October they embarked on a series of assistants, of whom the first on a commercial footing was\n      Ralph Partridge\n      , engaged in August 1920. They acquired more type, but also came to an arrangement with a local printer to print extra copies of their second publication,\n      Katherine Mansfield\n      's\n      Prelude\n      \u2014a practice they repeated later with other works and other commercial printers. After the financial success of Virginia's\n      Kew Gardens\n      , Leonard bought the Press a brass nameplate costing half a guinea. In November 1921 they took delivery of a second-hand Minerva printing press worked by a heavy treadle which cost \u00a370.10s, and 77 pounds weight of type at a price of \u00a318.9s.5d. (This press, given by Virginia to\n      Vita Sackville-West\n      , is today on display at\n      Sissinghurst\n      .) In mid 1922 the Press reached another landmark with the engagement of Marjorie Thomson (or Joad).\n      Others who worked at the Press included\n      George (Dadie) Rylands\n      (who later recalled \"many happy hours setting up type with Virginia\"),\n      Richard Kennedy\n      (who published\n      <em>\n       A Boy at the Hogarth Press\n      </em>\n      in 1972), and from 1931\n      John Lehmann\n      (who published\n      <em>\n       Thrown to the Woolfs\n      </em>\n      in 1978).\n      The diary of the sixteen-year-old Kennedy (reconstructed later, and therefore inherently suspect) is nonetheless delightful in its sharpness and naivety. On first meeting, Leonard looked to him like \"an extremely intellectual wolf . . . a very Socrates of wolves.\"\n      In cutting pages and parcelling up review copies, \"Mrs W is a pretty fast worker considering she's not a professional like Miss Belcher and myself.\"\n      When asked at a party what he thought of her books and confessing that he found them heavy, he \"felt rather like Peter denying Christ.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The Press, which began as therapy and for the purpose of publishing the works of its owners, grew into a major engine of modern culture and thought.\n      Its political interests were served by \"enlightened and clear thinking from well-informed persons on such . . . issues as disarmament, the\n      League of Nations\n      , imperialism, racial prejudice, education reform, labor conditions, socialism, etc.\"\n      It launched and maintained a number of specialised series, covering the new discipline of psychoanalysis as well as literature and politics. (One of its achievements was making available in England the papers of the International Psycho-Analytical Institute in\n      Vienna\n      .) It published creative works by\n      Katherine Mansfield\n      ,\n      T. S. Eliot\n      ,\n      E. M. Forster\n      ,\n      Christopher Isherwood\n      ,\n      and\n      Vita Sackville-West\n      (generally when these authors were still little known), non-fiction by\n      Roger Fry\n      ,\n      Gertrude Stein\n      ,\n      Jane Harrison\n      , and\n      Viscountess Rhondda\n      , and translations (mostly the first in English) of\n      Chekhov\n      ,\n      Gorky\n      , and\n      Freud\n      .\n      The list reflects some of the most significant strands in contemporary thought.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW was especially pleased with her new ability to publish her own texts. She later observed: \"I'm the only woman in England free to write what I like.\"\n      The Press also allowed for collaboration with her sister:\n      Vanessa Bell\n      designed many covers for its books, including most of those written by Virginia.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW herself did editorial work and some type-setting and binding, but Leonard took most of the daily decisions and did most of the administrative work, with the Press's gradually growing and often changing staff.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       23 February 1938\n      </strong>\n      VW signed an agreement with\n      John Lehmann\n      , selling her share in the\n      Hogarth Press\n      for \u00a33,000; from now on Lehmann was\n      Leonard\n      's partner in the press.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      During the previous fifteen years of its life it had earned an income of \u00a3814 per annum (an average which takes in the total of three pounds in 1924 and \u00a32,442 in 1938, its most profitable year up to that point).

In August 1920 Woolf commented on Mansfield in her diary: \"a woman caring as I care for writing is rare enough I suppose to give me the queerest sense of echo coming back to me from her mind the second after I've spoken.\"\n      They discussed works by\n      Dorothy Richardson\n      ,\n      May Sinclair\n      , and\n      T. S. Eliot\n      , along with each other's ideas and writing. Mansfield reviewed Woolf's\n      Night and Day\n      and\n      Kew Gardens\n      , and the\n      Hogarth Press\n      published Mansfield's\n      Prelude\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Mansfield was still on VW's mind in July 1928, five years after her death: Woolf recalled a dream in which Mansfield was \"lying on a sofa in a room high up, &amp; a great many sad faced women were round her.\"\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Ottoline Morrell\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       17-19 November 1917\n      </strong>\n      VW visited\n      Garsington Manor\n      , home of\n      Lady Ottoline\n      and\n      Philip Morrell\n      , for the first time.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      After this VW saw Ottoline Morrell many times at Garsington and at Ottoline's other salons, where guests included\n      W. B. Yeats\n      ,\n      Aldous Huxley\n      ,\n      Mark Gertler\n      , and\n      Dorothy Brett\n      , among many others.\n      Relations between them were difficult, however, in large part because Lady Ottoline felt the sting of Bloomsbury's, and of Woolf's, mockery. When they first met, VW was \"all gush\" in a letter to her but satiric about her in conversation with others.\n      Nevertheless, the two were linked by politics and the war. Phillip Morrell, Ottoline's husband, a Liberal Member of Parliament, took a stand in the House of Commons against war fever, and Ottoline herself took in conscientious objectors as labourers on her farm at Garsington. Though the two women were not close in the 1920s, they became more so in the 1930s, and they remained friends until Lady Ottoline's death in 1938. VW wrote her obituary for the\n      Times\n      .\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      T. S.

Eliot\n      visited VW for the first time, thereby beginning a lasting association.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Leonard Woolf wrote to Eliot, whose\n      Prufrock and Other Observations\n      he had read, to invite him to send some work to the\n      Hogarth Press\n      . The letter led to a meeting, and ultimately to the publication by the Press of Eliot's\n      Poems\n      , 1919,\n      The Waste Land\n      , 1923, and\n      Homage to John Dryden, Three Essays on Poetry of the Seventeenth Century\n      , 1924. In her diary entry for the day on which she and\n      Eliot\n      met, Woolf notes that \"beneath the surface it is fairly evident that he is very intellectual, intolerant, with strong views of his own, &amp; a poetic creed. I'm sorry to say that this sets up\n      Ezra Pound\n      &amp;\n      Wyndham Lewis\n      as great poets, or in the current phrase 'very interesting' writers. He admires\n      Mr Joyce\n      immensely.\"\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Early in their friendship Woolf sensed Eliot's intellectual ambitions and strengths, but she also detected his reserve and playfully mocked him: as \"sharp, narrow &amp; much of a stick,\"\n      or as coming to dinner in \"a four-piece suit.\"\n      Their friendship became easier as it aged. He favourably reviewed\n      \"Monday or Tuesday\"\n      and published\n      \"On Being Ill\"\n      in the first number of his\n      New Criterion\n      (lately, and soon to be again,\n      The Criterion\n      ). When he adopted British nationality, in 1927, Leonard Woolf was one of his sponsors.\n      The conversation between Woolf and Eliot left its mark in her work, and she admired him enough to admonish herself not to try to be like him.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       18 June 1922\n      </strong>\n      T.

But Joyce, together with\n      Dorothy Richardson\n      , affected the way she wrestled with the relation between 'reality' and 'consciousness'. Recent critics have emphasized the complexity of her response to Joyce.\n     </div>\n<h4>\n      Jane Harrison\n     </h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      The classical scholar\n      Jane Ellen Harrison\n      made a great impact on Woolf's views on women in scholarship and women in history.

Satire is to be the main note.\"\n      Censorship, and in particular censorship of sexual subject matter, had long been on VW's mind.

Though she joined others in condemning censorship of Hall's book, VW made it clear that she did not think highly of the novel itself, which she described in her diary as a \"meritorious dull book\".\n      The experience of the trial, however, fed into her thinking about the linked issues of gender, sexuality, and freedom of expression.\n     </div>\n<h3>\n      Ethel Smyth\n     </h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       20 February 1930\n      </strong>\n      VW met and began a friendship with\n      Ethel Smyth\n      , a generation older than herself: composer, author, militant suffragist, former close friend and future biographer of\n      Emmeline Pankhurst\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Their meeting was prompted by a letter Smyth sent to Woolf expressing her great admiration for\n      A Room of One's Own\n      and for Woolf's creative genius more generally. She was \"a person of enormous definiteness and determination,\" and VW had already read several volumes of her autobiography.\n      The friendship came to be strained by Smyth's unrestrained demands, but the two respected and enjoyed one another. Ethel influenced the shape and matter of Virginia's later texts, and helped her to think and write about her own life with increased clarity and force.\n      Virginia described to Ethel (and thereby reviewed for herself) the difficult process of writing\n      The Waves\n      , which she was finishing when they me; and. Ethel's experience and personality also provided material for Woolf's construction of the characters of Rose Pargiter in\n      The Years\n      and Miss La Trobe in\n      Between the Acts\n      . In her letters to Ethel VW was often more candid about her personal history, including her childhood abuse, than in letters to other friends.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      In her speech to the\n      London and National Society for Women's Service\n      in 1931, VW described Ethel Smyth as \"of the race of pioneers, of pathmakers.

She and her Bloomsbury friends began to be seen as politically ineffectual, as pacifism was rejected by both established and younger generations of writers and thinkers\u2014including\n      W. H. Auden\n      ,\n      Julian Bell\n      (Virginia's nephew),\n      John Lehmann\n      ,\n      Wyndham Lewis\n      , and\n      Stephen Spender\n      , most of whom Woolf knew and published through the\n      Hogarth Press\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      But Woolf recorded in her diary in May 1940: \"Thinking is my fighting.\"\n      Her thinking manifested itself in various ways. She was involved to varying degrees with a number of leftist associations: the\n      Labour Party\n      , the\n      International Association of Writers for the Defence of Culture\n      , the\n      National Peace Council\n      , the\n      FIL (For Intellectual Liberty)\n      ; the Artists International Association; and the\n      Council for Civil Liberties\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      However, she grew to be strongly opposed to most political and cultural institutions in their current form, regardless of their expressed ideologies. Public response to the British monarchy, which on the occasion of the funeral of\n      George V\n      combined \"a curious survival of barbarism, emotionalism, heraldry, ecclesiasticalism, sheer sentimentality, snobbery,\" and fellow-feeling for a \"commonplace man . . . so like ourselves,\" filled her with fascinated curiosity.\n      In her writing, especially\n      Three Guineas\n      , \"Woolf turn[s] on its head the common belief that [Western] civilisation had to defend itself against the barbarities of Fascism. Standing on the edge of the debate as an outsider, a self-educated woman reader and writer, she constructed a critical version of British social history.\"\n      On principle she refused to accept official honours or awards.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       February 1932\n      </strong>\n      VW refused to deliver the Clark lecture series at\n      Cambridge University\n      , thereby also declining to succeed her father, scholar\n      Leslie Stephen\n      , in this honour.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       March 1933\n      </strong>\n      VW rejected on principle an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the\n      University of Manchester\n      .

Bowen's work (especially\n      <em>\n       The Hotel\n      </em>\n      ) shows Woolf's influence, and she often approached Woolf with \"awe and alarm\"; Woolf saw Bowen as \"sterling &amp; sharp edged,\" and expressed interest in her texts, particularly\n      The House in Paris\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      At Bowen's\n      London\n      home, Woolf met\n      May Sarton\n      , but their brief association did not develop beyond the superficial.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph chronstruct\">\n<strong>\n       13 September 1934\n      </strong>\n      Feeling his loss profoundly, VW attended\n      Roger Fry\n      's funeral.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      Thinking of their mutual creative influence and of Fry's place in her family, Woolf surprised herself by grieving even more deeply for Fry than she had for another great friend,\n      Lytton Strachey\n      , who had died in January 1932. Roger's sister\n      Margery Fry\n      and his mistress\n      Helen Anrep\n      both asked Woolf to write his biography. She agreed, but found as time went on that it became a complicated, taxing responsibility.\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      In March and April 1936 VW had a period of threatened breakdown. This was a time of overwork against the clock (not uncommon in her professional life), of the visible political threat of\n      Hitler\n      (who had just invaded the\n      Rhineland\n      ), and the consequent immersion of\n      Leonard Woolf\n      in political work which Virginia found disturbing.

She read\n      <em>\n       Moses and Monotheism\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Civilisation and its Discontents\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego\n      </em>\n      , \"Thoughts for the Time on War &amp; Death\", and\n      <em>\n       Why War?\n      </em>\n      Hermione Lee\n      observes that \"[r]eading Freud shocked and disturbed, as well as inspired her.

Her interpretations of his work are found in such texts as\n      Three Guineas\n      ,\n      Between the Acts\n      , and, most directly, her essay \"The Leaning Tower\".

In the event of an invasion of England, they could indeed expect a terrible personal fate, on account of their anti-war politics, Leonard's anti-war career and his Jewish heritage. Though they did not have certain knowledge of this at the time, the Woolfs were on Hitler's 350-page 'Arrest List' for Britain.\n      Others (unknowingly) on this list included\n      Nancy Cunard\n      ,\n      Margery Fry\n      ,\n      Aldous\n      and\n      Julian Huxley\n      ,\n      Naomi Mitchison\n      ,\n      Harold Nicolson\n      ,\n      Sylvia Pankhurst\n      ,\n      Bertrand Russell\n      ,\n      Sylvia Townsend Warner\n      ,\n      Beatrice Webb\n      , and\n      Rebecca West\n      .\n     </div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n      VW was especially devastated by the effects of Nazi air raids on\n      London\n      .

She recorded her observations \"in a shocked, rapid, jagged, intensely observant language.\"\n      Woolf wrote about the bombing mainly in her diary, but in a letter to\n      Ethel Smyth\n      she suggests that \"what touched and indeed raked what I call my heart in London was the grimy old women at the lodging house at the back, all dirty after the raid, &amp; preparing to sit out another . . .
